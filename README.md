## <a name="motivation"></a>Motivation

The motivation to create this prototype is to apply what I have learned in the pathway.  

In the pathway, I learn the following:

- Intro to game development;
- Intro to game planning;
- Intro to C#;
- How to develop gameplay;
- How to make the player interact with the game;
- How to create sound and visual effects;
- How to create a user interface;
- Bug fixing;
- User testing;
- Career preparation;
- Version control;
- OOP;
- ECS;
- Store data;
- etc.

In addition to what was taught in the pathway I studied and implemented the cinemachine camera in the prototype.

The game design document is available here: [Escape - GDOC](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XW3t04FCf1aHoKdm49ykjIFXUxe017e39GnX4VPg1pI/edit?usp=sharing)
